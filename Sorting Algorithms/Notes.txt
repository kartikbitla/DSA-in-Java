1. Bubble sort -
 - Bubble srt is also referred as Sinking sort
 - We repeatedly compare each pair of adjacent items and swap them if they are in the wrong order

when to use Bubble Sort?
 - When the input is almost sorted
 - Space is concern
 - Easy to implement

When to avoid Bubble Sort?
 - Average time complexity is poor


2. Selection sort-
 - In case of selection sort we repeatedly find the minimum element and move it to the sorted part of array to make unsorted part sorted. 

When to use Selection sort?
 - When we have insufficient memory
 - Easy to implement

When to avoid Selection Sort?
 - When time is a concern
